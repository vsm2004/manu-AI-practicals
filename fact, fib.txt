fibonacci(0, 0). % Base case: Fibonacci number at position 0 is 0
fibonacci(1, 1). % Base case: Fibonacci number at position 1 is 1

fibonacci(N, Result) :-
    N > 1,         % Ensure N is greater than 1
    N1 is N - 1,   % Decrement N by 1
    N2 is N - 2,   % Decrement N by 2
    fibonacci(N1, Fib1), % Recursively calculate Fibonacci number at N-1
    fibonacci(N2, Fib2), % Recursively calculate Fibonacci number at N-2
    Result is Fib1 + Fib2. % Add the two previous Fibonacci numbers to get the result
